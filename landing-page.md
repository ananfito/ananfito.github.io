This is a sample landing page I created as part of [the Responsive Web Design course created by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). This page is one of the required projects to earn a certification for the course. The [developer certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ananfito/responsive-web-design) I earned as part of completing the course represents approximately 300 hours of coursework.

A live version of this landing page can be viewed at https://ananfito.github.io/2149-book.
