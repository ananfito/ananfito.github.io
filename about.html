        <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>

        <p>During my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I discovered the creativity and joy that comes from solving problems. I thought this would be best put into practice as a teacher of mathematics.</p>
        <p>After 10+ years in the classroom, I have came to realize that the problems I encounter as a teacher are not the same kind of problems I enjoyed solving as an undergraduate. However, I discovered that building things with code presents the types of problems I do want to solve.</p>
        <p>In late 2020, I started exploring the world of coding by studying Python and data analysis. By 2022, I was diving deep into web development and learning how to create interactive web applications with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>With my newfound programming skills, I built my first web app — <a href="https://github.com/ananfito/mathemaquizzo/" class="link" target="_blank">a mathematical quiz app</a> — and I used <a href="https://blog.ananfito.dev/using-python-to-make-my-teaching-job-easier" class="link" target="_blank">a Python script</a> which helped me more effectively communicate grades to my students. Both these projects presented challenges, but I enjoyed every minute of solving them. It reminded me of the joy I experienced when studying mathematics as an undergraduate.</p>
        <p>Since completing these inaugural projects, I have continued to learn and grow. In January 2025, I started my graduate studies in the Master of Science in Business Analytics at California State University, Sacramento. Through my studies I have built upon my programming foundation and deepened my understanding of using statistical analysis and machine learning to achieve business outcomes. Currently, I am seeking a full-time role where I can bring my joy of problem-solving and technical abilities to have an impact and create prosperous outcomes for buisness objectives.</p>
