# Analytics Projects
## [CASE STUDY: How does a bike share navigate speedy success?](https://rpubs.com/anthonynanfito/case_study_cyclistic)
### Scenario
Cyclistic is a successful bike-share program launched in 2016. It has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic offers a variety of pricing plans including: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase a single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

### Ask: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
The goal of the assigned business task is to investigate the bike share data for differences in usage between annual members and casual riders. The insights gained will be shared with the Cyclistic marketing team. The Director of Marketing is interested in expanding annual memberships by designing targeted ad campaigns for converting casual riders to annual members.

### Key Recommendations
- Casual riders take rides of longer duration during the weekends. To encourage casual riders to become members, Cyclistic could partner with special events that occur on weekends. For example, they could partner with concert venues or sporting events.
- Casual riders have their peak ride times during the months of April, May, and June. To encourage them to continue using the bike share service, special promotions for membership could be offer outside of peak times in effort to encourage them to continue using the service. This could also be applied during the work-week (M-F) when casual riders are less-likely to use the service.
- Lastly, Cyclistic could partner with restaurants and recreational facilities near the Top 10 Start/End locations. As an example a discounted bike share membership could be offered when they purchase an item at a local business near these locations.
